## What is "managed code"?

When working with .NET, you'll often encounter the term "managed code". 
To put it simply, managed code is just that:

> *code whose execution is managed by a runtime*.

In this case, the runtime in question is called the *Common Language Runtime or CLR*, regardless of the implementation (for example, Mono, .NET Framework, or .NET Core/.NET 5+). The CLR is in charge of taking the managed code, compiling it into machine code and then executing it. 
On top of that, the runtime provides several important services such as automatic memory management, security boundaries, and type safety.


Contrast this to the way you would run a C/C++ program, also called "unmanaged code". In the unmanaged world, the programmer is in charge of pretty much everything. The actual program is, essentially, a binary that the operating system (OS) loads into memory and starts.
Everything else, from memory management to security considerations are a burden of the programmer.

> A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions.

Managed code is written in one of the high-level languages that can be run on top of .NET, such as C#, Visual Basic, F# and others. When you compile code written in those languages with their respective compiler, you don't get machine code.
You get Intermediate Language code which the runtime then compiles and executes. 

## Intermediate Language & execution
What is "Intermediate Language" (or IL for short)? It is a product of compilation of code written in high-level .NET languages. Once you compile your code written in one of these languages, you will get a binary that is made out of IL. 
It is important to note that the IL is independent from any specific language that runs on top of the runtime.

Once you produce IL from your high-level code, you will most likely want to run it. This is where the CLR takes over and starts the process of Just-In-Time compiling, or JIT-ing your code from IL to machine code that can actually be run on a CPU. 
In this way, the CLR knows exactly what your code is doing and can effectively manage it.

> Intermediate Language is sometimes also called Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or common intermediate language (CIL).
